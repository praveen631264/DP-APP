## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the comprehensive business requirements for **IntelliDocs**, an intelligent, end-to-end document processing and management system. It details the system's expected functionality, technical architecture, and operational capabilities.

### 1.2 Project Overview & Goals

**IntelliDocs** aims to streamline organizational document workflows by integrating an intuitive user interface with a powerful AI-driven back-end. The primary goals are to:
-   Minimize manual data entry and document handling.
-   Maximize the accuracy of extracted information.
-   Provide a centralized and searchable repository for all documents.
-   Unlock strategic insights from unstructured document content.

### 1.3 Intended Audience

This document is intended for:
-   **Project Sponsors & Stakeholders**: To understand the project's scope and business value.
-   **Development & QA Teams**: To guide the design, development, and testing of the application.
-   **System Administrators & DevOps**: To understand the deployment and operational requirements.
-   **Project Managers**: To manage the project's scope, schedule, and resources.

## 2. Business Problem & Opportunity

### 2.1 Business Problem

-   **Fragmented Workflow**: Employees use multiple, disconnected tools for document storage, data entry, and analysis, leading to inefficiency.
-   **High Manual Effort**: Manually extracting information and cross-referencing documents is time-consuming, error-prone, and mentally taxing.
-   **Lack of Visibility**: It is difficult to get a high-level overview of the document lifecycle, making it hard to track processing status, identify bottlenecks, or analyze trends.

### 2.2 Opportunity

By developing IntelliDocs, we can:
-   **Provide a Unified Platform**: Offer a single, cohesive system for all document-related tasks.
-   **Enhance Productivity**: Automate data extraction and provide a user-friendly interface to simplify document management.
-   **Deliver Actionable Insights**: Offer a real-time dashboard that visually represents document statistics, making it easy to understand and act upon the data.

## 3. Scope

### 3.1 In-Scope Features

#### Core Back-End Functionality

1.  **Document Lifecycle Management**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for documents, including soft-delete to prevent accidental data loss.
2.  **Asynchronous AI Processing**: On upload, the system will asynchronously perform:
    *   **Text Extraction**: Support for various formats (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, TXT).
    *   **AI-Powered Analysis**: Extraction of Key-Value Pairs (KVPs) and document categorization using a configurable Large Language Model (LLM).
    *   **Vector Embedding**: Generation of semantic embeddings for advanced search capabilities.
3.  **Audit Trail**: A comprehensive, immutable audit log for every document, tracking all status changes and actions from creation to deletion.
4.  **Manual Override**: API endpoints to allow users to manually correct extracted KVPs and re-classify documents.
5.  **Analytics & Search**:
    *   An aggregation endpoint to feed the front-end dashboard with real-time statistics.
    *   A semantic search endpoint that uses vector similarity to find relevant documents.
6.  **System Health**: A `/health` endpoint for monitoring service availability.

### 3.2 Out-of-Scope Features (for this version)

-   **User Authentication & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
-   **Multi-Tenancy**
-   **Real-time Collaboration & Document Locking**

## 4. Functional & Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Functional Requirements

| Feature ID | Feature                 | User Story                                                                                                                              |
|------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BE-001     | Document Upload         | As a developer, I need an API endpoint to upload a document so that it can be processed asynchronously.                                |
| BE-002     | Document Status         | As a developer, I need to track the document's status (e.g., `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`) throughout its lifecycle.   |
| BE-003     | AI Analysis             | As a system, IntelliDocs must extract text, determine a category, and identify KVPs from a document using an AI model.                |
| BE-004     | Semantic Search         | As a developer, I need a search endpoint that returns documents based on the semantic meaning of my query, not just keywords.          |
| BE-005     | Soft Deletion           | As a developer, I need to soft-delete documents so that they can be recovered if needed.                                                |
| BE-006     | Audit Trail             | As a system administrator, I need a complete audit log for each document to ensure traceability and for debugging purposes.         |
| BE-007     | Dashboard Stats         | As a developer, I need an endpoint that provides aggregated data (e.g., counts by category, status) for the dashboard.                |
| BE-008     | Edit & Re-categorize    | As a developer, I need endpoints to manually update a document's KVPs and category to correct AI errors.                                |

### 4.2 Non-Functional Requirements

-   **Performance**: Asynchronous processing tasks should not block the main application thread. API responses for queries should average under 200ms.
-   **Reliability**: The back-end service must have an uptime of at least 99.9%. Failed processing tasks should be logged and should not crash the worker.
-   **Scalability**: The system must be scalable horizontally by adding more Celery workers to handle increased document load.
-   **Configurability**: Critical parameters such as database connections, AI model names, and secret keys must be configurable via environment variables.

## 5. System Architecture Overview

*(For a detailed breakdown, please refer to `architecture.md`)*

-   **Web Server**: A Flask application serves the RESTful API.
-   **Task Queue**: Celery, with Redis as the message broker, manages the asynchronous processing of documents.
-   **Database**: MongoDB, utilizing GridFS for file storage, a `documents` collection for metadata, a `documents_audit` collection for logging, and a Vector Search index for semantic search.
-   **AI Services**: The system integrates with a configurable Large Language Model via the `langchain` library for analysis and uses `sentence-transformers` for creating embeddings.
