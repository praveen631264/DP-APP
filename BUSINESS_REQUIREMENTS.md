# Business Requirement Document: IntelliDocs

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2023-10-27

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the business requirements for **IntelliDocs**, an intelligent document processing and management system. Its purpose is to provide a clear and comprehensive foundation for all project stakeholders, including developers, project managers, and business analysts, ensuring that the final product aligns with the strategic goals of the organization.

### 1.2 Project Overview & Goals

In many organizations, a significant amount of time and resources are spent on manually processing, categorizing, and extracting information from a high volume of documents like invoices, receipts, and reports. This manual process is often slow, error-prone, and difficult to scale.

**IntelliDocs** is a back-end service designed to automate this entire workflow. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), the system will automatically read uploaded documents, extract key-value data, categorize them into predefined pools, and provide a robust API for management and analysis. The primary goal is to increase efficiency, reduce manual errors, and provide valuable, real-time insights into the document ecosystem.

### 1.3 Intended Audience

This document is intended for:
-   **Project Sponsors & Stakeholders**: To understand the project's scope and business value.
-   **Development Team**: To guide the design, development, and testing of the application.
-   **Quality Assurance Team**: To create test plans and validate that the system meets all specified requirements.
-   **Project Managers**: To manage the project's scope, schedule, and resources.

## 2. Business Problem & Opportunity

### 2.1 Business Problem

-   **High Operational Cost**: Manual data entry and document sorting require significant human labor, leading to high operational costs.
-   **Prone to Human Error**: Manual processing is susceptible to errors in data extraction and categorization, which can lead to incorrect data and poor business decisions.
-   **Lack of Scalability**: The manual process cannot easily scale to handle sudden increases in document volume.
-   **Poor Data Accessibility**: Information trapped in unstructured documents is not easily searchable or analyzable, leading to missed insights.

### 2.2 Opportunity

By developing IntelliDocs, we have the opportunity to:
-   **Drastically Reduce Processing Time**: Automate data extraction and categorization to process documents in seconds instead of minutes.
-   **Improve Data Accuracy**: Minimize human error by using AI models for consistent and accurate data handling.
-   **Enable Real-Time Insights**: Transform unstructured data into a structured, queryable format, accessible via a dashboard for real-time analytics.
-   **Create a Scalable Solution**: Build a system that can grow with the organization's needs.

## 3. Project Goals & Objectives

-   **Goal 1**: Automate the document lifecycle from upload to archival.
    -   **Objective**: Reduce the average document processing time by at least 95% compared to the current manual baseline.
-   **Goal 2**: Ensure high accuracy in data extraction and categorization.
    -   **Objective**: Achieve an auto-categorization accuracy of 90% or higher after the initial model training period.
-   **Goal 3**: Provide a centralized and user-friendly platform for document management.
    -   **Objective**: Deliver a comprehensive API that allows for document searching, filtering, validation, and retrieval.
-   **Goal 4**: Offer actionable insights into document processing metrics.
    -   **Objective**: Develop a real-time analytics dashboard that tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) like total documents processed, accuracy rates, and average processing times.

## 4. Scope

### 4.1 In-Scope Features

1.  **Document Upload**: Users can upload documents in various formats (`PDF`, `DOCX`, `TXT`, `XLSX`, `MD`).
2.  **Asynchronous AI Processing**: Uploaded documents are placed in a queue for background processing to avoid blocking user requests.
3.  **Automated Data Extraction**: The system automatically extracts key-value pairs (KVPs) from documents.
4.  **Automated Document Categorization**: The system automatically assigns a category (e.g., "Invoice", "Receipt") to each document.
5.  **Manual Validation & Correction**:
    -   Users can manually correct or update the extracted KVPs.
    -   Users can re-categorize a document if the AI classifies it incorrectly.
6.  **Document Search & Retrieval**:
    -   Users can search for documents by filename.
    -   Users can retrieve a list of all documents or filter them by category.
    -   Users can fetch the detailed information of a single document by its ID.
7.  **Original File Download**: Users can download the original file that was uploaded.
8.  **Analytics Dashboard**: An API endpoint provides aggregated statistics for a real-time dashboard, including processing accuracy and document pool metrics.
9.  **System Health Check**: An endpoint is available to monitor the health and availability of the service.

### 4.2 Out-of-Scope Features (for this version)

-   **User Authentication & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: All API endpoints are currently public.
-   **Multi-Tenancy**: The system does not support separate data environments for different clients or departments.
-   **Front-End User Interface**: This project covers only the back-end API service.
-   **Advanced AI Model Fine-Tuning Interface**: While data for fine-tuning is collected, there is no user-facing interface to trigger or manage the tuning process.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

-   **Performance**: The API should have an average response time of less than 200ms for non-processing requests. Asynchronous document processing should ideally be completed within 30 seconds on average.
-   **Scalability**: The system architecture must support horizontal scaling to handle an increasing volume of documents.
-   **Security**: All sensitive information, such as API keys and database credentials, must not be hard-coded and should be managed via environment variables.
-   **Maintainability**: The codebase must be modular (e.g., using Flask Blueprints) and follow standard Python coding practices (PEP 8) to ensure ease of maintenance.
-   **Usability**: The API must be clearly documented, with an `API_REFERENCE.md` file that details all endpoints, parameters, and example responses.
